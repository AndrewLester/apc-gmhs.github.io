⚠️  SLIGHTLY SERIOUS UPDATE ALERT ⚠️
<br>
<br>
Hey guys unfortunately I can’t open this update with “que es bueno mis compadres” because it’s supposed to be serious which kinda sucks. 
I wanted to let you all know that based on the results of our last poll, we have decided to move forward with bringing in Mr. Timothy B. Lee as a guest speaker. He will be speaking to the club on November 20th at 11am, and we’d really love it if you guys would come — both because it’ll actually be fairly interesting (definitely more interesting than listening to me speak) and because he’s taking time out of his day to come talk to us. 
We’ll include some of his work in our compendiums until his talk and will keep reminding you of his visit — it’s also viewable on our calendar.
<br>
Thank you!
<br>
Jonathan
