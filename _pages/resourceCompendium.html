          <h1>COMPENDIUM ENTRY #1 - 9/18/2020</h1>
          <p>
            Hey there guys, its your main man Mr. Andrew Lester and I'm excited
            to bring you the first edition of APC's nationally syndicated
            <strong>RESOURCE COMPENDIUM</strong> (make bold). Today we've put
            together a few articles about what this wacky thing we call
            """computer science""" actually is, what coding means and a fun
            little test about how you've interacted with FCCPS' information
            technology. This compendium entry is on schoology, but future ones
            will be on the official APC Website. Reminder our first meeting is
            next Friday (9/25/20) at 11am. If you don't show up I will be
            incredibly disappointed, and perhaps even saddened.
            <br />
            <br />
            Andrew

            ayo ppl its Jonathan Aimison Oppenheimer with the APC's second
            weekly compendium. Due to the APC's incredible work ethic, complete
            mastery of website development and quick production schedules, we
            failed to do literally any work at all on the website. This means
            the statement in our prior update, indicating future compendium
            entries would be on our website, was a complete and utter
            fabrication. This week I've got some introductory resources to HTML
            and CSS (the tools we use very well and quickly to make the APC
            website) and of course the second Kanye fact.

              The Second Kanye Fact™ - did you know on september 15th, kanye
              west started talking about how egregious the contracts that major
              labels place on young individuals are, and was infuriated by this.
              on september 16th, a day later, he proceeded to tweet out each
              page of his contracts, but not before failing to do that, by
              accidentally tweeting out the file name instead of the actual
              file. later on in the day, he tweeted a video of him engaging in
              questionable actions upon a grammy award (serves them right for
              the amount of snubs they've given out especially in 2013), and
              then got banned from twitter for 12 hours for revealing personal
              information about a white supremacist. (courtesy of rohan v suri)
